Revision history for Selenium-Remote-Driver

0.12   9-20-2011
        - Tests now use mock recordings for each major os
          this will be expanded to include different versions
          of selenium
        - added module metadata so bug tracking and repository
          info will appear on metacpan (Thanks Tom Hukins!)
        - Fixed issue with find_child_element(s) which caused
          search methods which had 2+ words to fail
          ("css selector","class name","tag name", etc)

0.11   8-16-2011
  This is quite a large list for this release and will be
  the first cpan release. The later releases will hopefully 
  happen often and won't be quite as large.

        - subroutine calls carp when an error occurs or when
          an element cannot be found
        - if an element cannot be found, carp should tell you
          which line in your local script where the element was
          not found
        - added the following driver api calls
           click,double_click,button_down,button_up,close,status,
           send_modifier,execute_script,execute_async_script

        - fixed the following api calls
           refresh,delete_cookie_named
        - $element->get_value is deprecated...
           subroutine now points to get_attribute('value')
        - added the following element api calls
           describe
        - added initial IDE plugin for the Selenium-IDE
           (this is based off the Rspec webdriver ide plugin)

        - Added "extra_capabilities" named argument to the driver
        - make send_keys accept one or more string argument
        - added javascript method to driver
           (thanks Phil Kania!)

        - fixed issue: check for empty string before trying to decode
        - fixed issue: if script using the module ever forked, the
          driver would call quit whenever that fork was closed
        - fixed issue: Marked as deprecated: WebElement::set_selected
          and WebElement::toggle
        - fixed issue: global $driver variable in WebElement caused the
          remote connection to be destroyed before the driver was able
          to call quit()

        - fixed issues:
          - improper definition of setImplicitWaitTimeout
          - Driver.pm: missing 'css' entry in FINDERS
          - Driver.pm::find_elements: set up $using correctly
            (thanks Phil Mitchell!)

0.10    5-2-2010
        - Implemented support for JSON wire protocol as of a4 release of
        Selenium 2.0.
        - The main Driver & WebElement modules are implemented & functional.
        - Added unit tests for Driver. As of this moment only live testing is
        supported as the server itself is alpha & mocking its behavior doesn't
        help our cause.
        - Added POD for Driver & WebElement
0.01    2-21-2010
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
