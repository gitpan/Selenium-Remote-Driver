=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my %selenium_args = %{ TestHarness->new(
        this_file => $FindBin::Script
    )->base_caps };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A setup class for all the repetitive things we need to do before
running tests. First, we're deciding whether the test is in C<record>
or C<replay> mode. If we're recording, we'll end up writing all the
HTTP request/response pairs out to L</mock_file>. If we're replaying,
we'll look for our OS-appropriate mock_file and try to read from it.

After we figure that out, we can instantiate our
Mock::RemoteConnection with the proper constructor arguments and
return that as our base_args for use in the tests! Finally, on
destruction, if we're recording, we make sure to dump out all of the
request/response pairs to the mock_file.

=attr this_file

Required. Pass in the short name of the test file in use so we can
figure out where the corresponding recording belongs. For a test file
named C<t/01-driver.t>, we'd expect this argument to be
C<01-driver.t>.
